# moved to https://github.com/PHP-S7/phosphor7

# Phosphor7
... is a PHP library for accessing Step7-PLCs from PHP. It is a direct translation of the [Snap7](http://snap7.sourceforge.net) code

## Progress
At the moment you can only read and write DBs, but youre welcome to implement the missing code.

## Idea behind the code
I've tried to write the code as similar as possible to the original code in order to maintain updates easily.

# Searching new maintainer
Since I don't use S7 controllers anymore and therefore can't test code anymore, I'm looking for a new maintainer for this repository. Who likes? ðŸ¤“
